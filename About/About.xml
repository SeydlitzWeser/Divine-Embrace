        This mod started as something just for myself, but turned into a bigger project that I wanted to share to those who it'd appeal to.

        [h1]Cosmic Reverence[/h1]
        Cosmic Reverence is, to be frank, an extremely overpowered mod that adds a multi-purpose material, an infinite chemreactor-like building that produces it,
        bionics that cover every body parts and organs, a workbench to make them and two power generators. There is also a universal tool cabinet. Everything is
        unlocked after a veeery long research project.

        [h2] Full list of featured things:[/h2]
        [list]
        [h3][*]Research project:[/h3] Celestial manipulation. Has 100k research points for balance.
        [h3][*]Material:[/h3] Crimson nebulite. Counts as Stone, Wood, Metal and Cloth.
        [h3][*]Nebulous Condenser:[/h3] Building that generates 25 crimson nebulite every 10 days.
        [h3][*]Celestial Bionics:[/h3] A full suite of bionics, with some having special properties.
        [h3][*]Cosmic Forge:[/h3] The workbench which allows crafting those bionics. It's powered by a supernova similar to the power generators, but on a smaller scale.
        [h3][*]Nova Generator:[/h3] Produces 25k power at the risk of causing an explosion bigger than an anti-grain warhead if damaged.
        [h3][*]Portable Nova Generator:[/h3] A smaller version of the Nova Generator that produces 5k power with a risk of causing a smaller but still devastating explosion if damaged.
        [h3][*]Cosmic Cabinet:[/h3] A universal tool cabinet that provides a substantial work speed buff.
        [/list]
